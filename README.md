# Valorant-Agent-Picker-V1
 This is the Valorant Agent Picker in its first Version. Its very inefficient but it works perfectly.

 To use this agent picker you need to have python installed. You can get the installer from https://www.python.org/downloads/. Just install the latest version. 

After you installed the setup open the Windows command prompt. There type "pip install -r " with the space at the end and then drag the requirements.txt into the command prompt. Then press enter to execute the command. 
After you are finished with setting up python you can open up Valorant and start a custom match. Then open up ValorantAgentLocation.py. 
If it asks you with which program to open it choose the python launcher. 
After you have opened it you have five seconds to tab back into Valorant and hover your mouse over the first agent. 
You can go through the agents from left to right and top to bottom.
